# NO LONGER MAINTAINED

Since the launch of Kaia Blockchain this repository has been parked in favour of the new open-source projects in [Kaia's Github](https://github.com/kaiachain). Contributors have now moved there continuing with massive open-source contributions to our blockchain ecosystem. A big thank you to everyone who has contributed to this repository. For more information about Klaytn's chain merge with Finschia blockchain please refer to the launching of Kaia blockchain - [kaia.io](http://kaia.io/).
